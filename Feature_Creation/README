Instructions for using the code to generate the input  matrices employed in the MERIDA method. 
More detailed information on all used versions of all data sets and databases can be found in the Supplement S1 of the paper.
If you have questions, contact Kerstin Lenhof (klenhof@bioinf.uni-sb.de).

1. The available cell lines per drug can be generated using the script 'find_available_cell_lines.py'.
Needed files: 
- Mutation file 
- CNV file 
- Gene Expression file
- Drug response directory 

2. The test set can then be drawn from the available cell lines stratified with respect to the tissue (site) using the script 'draw_stratified_test_set.R'
Needed files:
- Annotation files for  the 'site' feature from GDSC

3. The z-score matrices can then be calculated depending on the drawn test set (using the script 'z_score_calculation_train_test_separated.py'). 

4. The resulting z-scores can be binarized using the script 'z_score_binarization.R'.

5. Annotation files for copy number and mutations can be generated using the script "preprocess_mut_cnv.py".
Needed files:
- Files from the 'Oncogenicity_Annotation'-folder
- Files from the 'Sensitivity_Annotation'-folder
- Files from the 'Mapping_Facility'-folder
- Mutation file 
- CNV file 

6. The data for the drugs was merged using the script 'unite_matrices.R' (Mut & CNV + GE + Drug Response). For drugs with a priori knowledge from the annotation step, 2 matrices have to be calculated (one with a priori knowledge and one without).
Needed files:
- GDSC1 & GDSC2 discretized response matrices

7. The final training and test set matrices are generated with 'subset_matrices.R'


To prepare the oncogenicity and sensitivity annotation files files from the 'Preparation_of_Databases' folder can be used.
At first the scripts with the database names (COSMIC, oncoKB, CIViC, CGI) in the file name should be used. Then the two mapper scripts can be used.
